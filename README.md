# Flashcard Quiz Game for Mobile App Development Class Project 1

Target audience - students in middle school to university

Scope: Flashcard Quiz Game - We designed a flashcard app for studying or learning new information in the categories of Science, Math and History. Users can create their own flashcards with questions and answers on various topics. They can test themselves by creating the flashcard questions, and then checking if their memorized/learned answer is correct by revealing the saved answer.
